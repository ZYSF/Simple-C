Simple C Compiler, Release 0.1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------
Simple C is a portable C compiler based on Small C/386. It is 
designed to run on Linux, but it should be usable on any Unix-
like operating system for the x86 with minimal effort.

This compiler generates assembly code for NASM. It also requires
the 'ld' tool from the GNU project (or an equivilent) to create
runnable applications.

As Simple C is based on Small C, the conditions of the original
copyright apply to it. Essentially the only condition is that 
you can't distribute this commercially without permission from 
J. Hendrix. See the end of this file for more details on this.

Getting started is fairly simple. Gunzip and detar the sources, 
then run "make default install". To compile an application, use 
the 'cc' script and wait a few seconds. Good luck and happy 
coding!
