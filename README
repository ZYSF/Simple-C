Simple C Compiler, Release 0.1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------
Simple C is a portable C compiler based on Small C/386. It is 
designed to run on Linux, but it should be usable on any Unix-
like operating system for the x86 with minimal effort.

This compiler generates assembly code for NASM. It also requires
the 'ld' tool from the GNU project (or an equivilent) to create
runnable applications.

As Simple C is based on Small C, it is also public domain. J. Hendrix
additions used to have a clause about commercial use, but it has been
removed in a public statement on his homepage where it states to be
”public domain”.

Getting started is fairly simple. Gunzip and detar the sources, 
then run "make default install". To compile an application, use 
the 'cc' script and wait a few seconds. Good luck and happy 
coding!
